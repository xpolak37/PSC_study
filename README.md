## Report info

This project analyses biopsy samples from two cohorts (Czech and Norwegian), namely data from amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (region V3-V4) and related clinical parameters relevant to PSC disease. 370 subjects are included, from whom a total of 1083 samples were collected.
